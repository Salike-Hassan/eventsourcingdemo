# ZIP Engineering Onboarding Tutorial

This project is for onboarding new engineers to Zip's engineering principles and tech stacks. We will be creating an inventory service and an order service. During this tutorial, you'll be able to see how we create services and how they communicate with each other.

## How do I get the best use out of this?
On the tutorial itself, we will be building an inventory service. However, we hope that we give you enough information for you to build an order service that can communicate with the inventory service. Of course, you do not have to build a service yourself. However, we think that we learn best by doing. 

## How do I navigate the tutorial?
For each steps, README.md will be provided to give you explanations on what we are doing and links to the next step. If you are already familiar with the subjects on each steps, feel free to skip over. We also included the table of content on the main README on the primary/master branch.
